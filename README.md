# HASH_GENERATOR-
Created by Tushar 
This web app generates hash values using various secure algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-3 (224, 256, 384, 512), Blake2s, Blake2b, and Shake-128. It ensures data integrity, password security, and cryptographic protection. Fast, reliable, and easy to use, it supports diverse hashing needs for security applications.

This web application allows users to generate hash values using a variety of secure hashing algorithms. Hashing is a one-way process that takes input data and produces a fixed-length output, known as the hash value. The app supports the following hashing algorithms:

MD5 – A widely-used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value, typically represented as a 32-character hexadecimal number. It's fast but considered insecure for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities.

SHA-256 – Part of the SHA-2 family, SHA-256 generates a 256-bit hash and is commonly used for data integrity verification and digital signatures.

SHA-1 – Though now deprecated due to vulnerabilities, SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash. It was once widely used in cryptography and certificate signatures.

SHA-512 – Also part of the SHA-2 family, it generates a 512-bit hash, offering stronger security than SHA-256, used in various cryptographic applications.

SHA-3-512 – The most secure member of the SHA-3 family, providing a 512-bit hash. SHA-3 offers different internal structures compared to SHA-2, making it resistant to certain types of attacks.

Blake2s – A high-speed cryptographic hash function that provides better security and faster performance than MD5 and SHA-1. It generates a 256-bit hash and is used in modern applications for secure hashing.

Shake-128 – A variable-length hash function from the SHA-3 family, Shake-128 allows users to generate hashes of any length. It uses the same underlying structure as SHA-3 but with a customizable output length.

SHA-3-256 – A member of the SHA-3 family that outputs a 256-bit hash. SHA-3-256 provides strong security and is used in various cryptographic systems.

Blake2b – Similar to Blake2s but with a longer output size of 512 bits, Blake2b is optimized for 64-bit platforms and offers high security and performance.

SHA-3-384 – Another variant from the SHA-3 family that produces a 384-bit hash. It's used in high-security applications requiring a strong and stable hash.

SHA-3-224 – This generates a 224-bit hash, providing a balance between security and performance, widely used in cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
